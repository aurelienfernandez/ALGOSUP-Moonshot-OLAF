### Overview

#### Context

This project is a moonshot project, a moonshot project is a project required by ALGOSUP to be able to have ALGOSUP's diploma. Each project is unique in his own way as it is proposed directly by students to a jury.

My Project is OLAF, it stands for OnLine Automated Farm. Like the name is suggesting, it is an automated farm or more precisely an automated planter.

#### Objectives

This Project's objectives can be described as these:

- Helping users to grow plant when they don't have time to allow for them
- Sickness and parasite detection for plants

#### Users 

### Functionnalities 

OLAF will have to be able to perform some tasks, these tasks may be separated into two categories, "in scope" and "out of scope tasks" in scope tasks are the most essential while out of scope tasks are tasks that can be interpreted as "possible improvement"

#### In Scope

The in scope tasks are:

- Collect datas such as air temperature, soil/air humidity.
- Manage water consumption to use just enough water to have a healthy plant.
-
