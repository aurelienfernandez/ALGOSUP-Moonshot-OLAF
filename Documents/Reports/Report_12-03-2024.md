# OLAF

## 27-03-2023 report

## Olaf

Olaf is an automated farm capable of sustaining the user's plants depending on their needs and their environment, it is also capable of collecting data about plants' environment and sending them to the user's phone, finally, its main point is that it is capable to detect plants' diseases or parasites and notify the user about it and explain to him how to proceed to heal the plant.

## Context

Time has passed since the last report, few advancements have been made and the project has a bit changed since the last report. The final objectives have been updated. 

## Objective status

### Previous objectives

The previous objectives were:
- The creation of an autonomous planter with embedded AI to detect plant diseases
- An app to retrieve the data from the planter
  
### Current objectives

The new objectives are:
- The creation of an autonomous planter with embedded AI to detect plant diseases
- An app to retrieve and detect plant disease by sending a picture to a server
- The creation of a strong and secure backend with a large enough scalability to handle at least 1 thousand users
- The creation of a website for administrator and maintainability purposes

### What is the current state of these objectives

- The right language has been found to create both the website and the mobile app: the website will be in angular and the mobile app in flutter
- All components of the planters are present and working
- The servers will be hosted by AWS
- I have learned how to code in flutter

### What are the next steps?

The next steps are in the following order:
- Create the whole backend, hopefully within the next weeks
- Create the first version of the mobile app
- Connect the mobile app
- Create the administrator website

An additional step is to regularly create reports to update the status of the project.

## Conclusion

The project has been delayed during the past months and started again in early January, reports are now set to be regularly created to update the project's state. The next steps are clear and now at least 5 hours per week are dedicated to the project, however, this might change as it is not entirely stable.
