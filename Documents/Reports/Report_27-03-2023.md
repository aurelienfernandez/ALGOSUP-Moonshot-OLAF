# OLAF

## 27-03-2023 report

## Olaf

Olaf is an automated farm capable of sustaining the user's plants depending on their needs and their environment, it is also capable to collect data about plants' environment and send them to the user's phone, finally, it's the main point is that it is capable to detect plants' diseases or parasites and notify the user about it and explain to him how to proceed to heal the plant.

## Context

This is the beginning of my Moonshot project, which I renamed OLAF which stands for "OnLine Automated Farm", as this is the start of this project I had to analyze the problem, analyze the market, and start multiple documents and researched how to process for this project.

## Objective status

### What were the objectives for now?

The objectives were:

- To starts multiple documents such as specifications,
- To buy every material needed for the project,
- To start research about the project, is there are concurrents, if the subject evolving, how it works, etc.
  
### What is the state of these objectives?

- The product specification is started but not finished yet,
- Every material required has been bought and is now received,
- I did some research, and now I mostly know how to proceed to accomplish my project,
- Concerning the last objective I now have a basic AI to detect plant diseases.

### What are the next steps?

The next steps are:

- Finish my documents,
- Start coding a prototype,
- Test the AI and improve it continuously.

## Conclusion

The project took some time to start, but now the project is advancing at a correct pace, most of the objectives are completed and the next objectives are set up in advance. Priorities are also set up, to compensate for any problematic issue. Finally, the most important part, is that AI, seems to work in a very small range of plants and diseases, more improvements are required and tests on it have to be regular and faultless.
