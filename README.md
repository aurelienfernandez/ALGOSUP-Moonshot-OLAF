# OLAF

## Context:

This project is called a "Moonshot project", this kind of project is a end of study project set up by ALGOSUP, the objective for students is to find a project which is innovative, creative, difficult and of course we need to code to create it.

## My Project:

## What is OLAF

My project is named OLAF, it stands for "OnLine Automated Farm", as the name suggests it is an automated farm, but not for professional uses, at least not for now, let me explain in the next section.

## Why

I figured out that not a lot of people can spend a lot of time to take care of plants, less of people can identify correctely how much a plant needs water or which temperature is ideal for their plant, and finally even less knows about plants diseases or parasites.

My goal is to create a planter capable of, at first, watering a plant, or even multiple plants, collect datas about it, and then communicate every data to an app installed by the user, these datas contain multiple informations such as:

- If the plant is sick or not by analysing images collected via a camera
- Temperature and soil/ambient humidity

## How

To do that I will use a raspberry PI 4 to control and process datas, it will control multiple element necessary for this project:

- The Azdelivery soi moisture sensor, which will collect datas about soil humidity.
- The Okdo 5mp camera.
- The sensor DHT22 which detects air humidity and temperature.
