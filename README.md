# OLAF

## Context:

This project is called a "Moonshot project", this kind of project is a end of study project set up by ALGOSUP, the objective for students is to find a project which is innovative, creative, difficult and of course we need to code to create it.

## What is OLAF

My project is named OLAF, it stands for "OnLine Automated Farm", as the name suggests it is an automated farm, but not for professional uses, It is provided along with a mobile app of the same name. The app possess some capabilities, add a plant pot, read a lexicon containing information about plants and diseases and finally the ability to detect diseases on some plants leaves. More details can be found in the written reports of the document folder.

## How to use

It is fairly simple to use, for now, only the mobile app is available. To install it you just have to plug your phone to your computer and download the APK present in the latest release. Once downloaded add it to your phone's files, into the "download" folder.

Finally your phone should ask you if you want to download the app, once the download is finished you can use it.
